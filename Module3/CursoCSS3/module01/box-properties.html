    <div id='content'>Rosa von Milde, also Rosalie von Milde, née Rosa Agthe
      (25 June 1827 – 25 January 1906) was a German operatic
      soprano and voice teacher. She was a leading singer at
      the Weimar Court Theatre from 1848 to 1867, which flourished
      when Franz Liszt directed it. She created, among others, the
      roles of Elsa in Wagner's Lohengrin, conducted by Liszt in 1850,
      and Margiana in Der Barbier von Bagdad by Peter Cornelius in
      1858.
