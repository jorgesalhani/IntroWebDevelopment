    <p>Rosa von Milde, also Rosalie von Milde,
     née Rosa Agthe (25 June 1827 – 25 January 1906) was a German
     operatic soprano and voice teacher. She was a leading singer
     at the Weimar Court Theatre from 1848 to 1867, which flourished
     when Franz Liszt directed it. She created, among others,
     the roles of Elsa in Wagner's Lohengrin, conducted by Liszt
     in 1850, and Margiana in Der Barbier von Bagdad by Peter
     Cornelius in 1858.</p>
