      <div id='text'>Rosa von Milde, also Rosalie von Milde,
         née Rosa Agthe (25 June 1827 – 25 January 1906) was a German
         operatic soprano and voice teacher. She was a leading singer
         at the Weimar Court Theatre from 1848 to 1867, which flourished
         when Franz Liszt directed it. She created, among others,
         the roles of Elsa in Wagner's Lohengrin, conducted by Liszt
         in 1850, and Margiana in Der Barbier von Bagdad by Peter
         Cornelius in 1858.
